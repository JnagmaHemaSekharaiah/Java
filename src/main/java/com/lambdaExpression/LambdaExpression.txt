Lambda Expression
------------------
LE are used to instances the Functional Interfcaes.

Syntax:

  School sc =
      (int x)  /*  Argument List */
        ->     /*  Arrow List */
      { System.out.println("School name is ...."+ x);};   /* Body of Lambda Expression */

      case 1:

        School sc =(x)->   / no need to mention the type of varibale
            {
                System.out.println("School name is ...."+ x);
            };

      case 2 : if we have one variable as the parameter no need to mention ()

           School sc = x->   / no need to mention the type of varibale
            {
                System.out.println("School name is ...."+ x);
            };
